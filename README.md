# myscotch
A Polymer 1.0 playground.  Mix between the scotch.io tutorial and the polymer starter kit

1. clone the project
2. cd myscotch
3. http-server -p9898
4. [view the app](http://localhost:9898)


I use the [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but any static file webserver will do.
